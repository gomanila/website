GoManila is a monthly meet up group focused on examining applications, frameworks, and technologies written in the Go programming language.

GoManila is also a member of the Go Developer Network, a collection of Go user groups working together with a shared mission to empower developer communities with the knowledge, experience, and wisdom to build the next generation of software in Go. 

You can join us at our Meetup group at [https://www.meetup.com/GoManilaPh/](https://www.meetup.com/GoManilaPh/).

We hold GoManila Mondays where we meet up and talk about Go-related topics on a Monday once a month.
