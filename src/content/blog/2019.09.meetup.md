This month we had Andre Marcelo-Tanner, Senior Site Reliability Engineer at Ada Support Inc; and Johnny Estilles, Regional Director of Engineering at Freelancer.com.

Andre talked about devising a single way to leverage Go to develop, deploy and monitor applications. Johnny explored the different usecases of Websockets in the context of the Go programming language.
